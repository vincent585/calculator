Vanilla JS Calculator with UI

Included in this project:
- responsive design
- completely functional calculator
- decimal input
- backspace and all clear functionality
- does not allow repeating operators
- sleek button animations
- division by zero does not break the calculator

Things to add:
- improve order of operations and allow multi-operator expressions
- keyboard support

I am really proud of how this project turned out as I really pushed myself to make this from what I call "true scratch", meaning absolute bare-minimum use of Google, StackOverflow, etc.
